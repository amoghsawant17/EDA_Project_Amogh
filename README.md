## üè® Introduction

In this project, we have analyzed a hotel booking dataset and discovered important factors that govern hotel bookings. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
This dataset contains booking information about two kinds of hotels such as a city hotel and a resort hotel. Data comprises 119390 rows and 32 columns. There are various parameters given in the data such as arrival date of booking, type of customer, repeated guest or not, arrival month for holiday booking, and number of weekday/ weekend stays.

## üè® Problem Statement

The problem is to analyze a hotel booking dataset from July 2015 to August 2017 and derive insights to address the following challenges:
* Booking Patterns and Seasonality: Identify seasonal trends, peak booking periods, and demand fluctuations to optimize resource allocation.
* Customer Segmentation and Preferences: Segment customers based on demographics and booking behavior to personalize marketing campaigns and enhance customer satisfaction.
* Booking Channels and Revenue Analysis: Evaluate the effectiveness of booking channels and optimize distribution strategies to maximize revenue.
* Cancellations: Variables impacting cancellations to minimize revenue losses and optimize occupancy rates.
